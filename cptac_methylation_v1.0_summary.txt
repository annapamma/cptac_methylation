CPTAC methylation array analysis summary: 

The methylation analysis was performed using the cross-package workflow
“methylationArrayAnalysis”
(https://master.bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/html/
methylationArrayAnalysis.html) available on Bioconductor. In brief, the raw
data files (IDAT files) were processed to obtain the methylated (M) and
unmethylated (U) signal intensities for each locus. The processing step
included an unsupervised normalization step called functional normalization
that has been previously implemented for Illumina 450K methylation arrays
(Fortin, JP, Aurélie Labbe, Mathieu Lemire, and BW Zanke. 2014. “Functional
normalization of 450k methylation array data improves replication in large
cancer studies.” Genome Biology 15 (503):1–17). A detection p value was also
calculated for each locus, and this p value captured the quality of detection
at the locus with respect to negative control background probes included in the
array. Loci having common SNPs (with MAF > 0.01), as per dbSNP build 132
through 147 via the UCSC snp132common track through snp147common track, were
removed from further analysis. Beta values were calculated as M/(M+U), that is
equal to the fraction methylated for each locus. Beta values of loci whose
detection p values were > 0.01 were assigned NA in the output file. All loci
are annotated with the annotation information from
‘MethylationEPIC_v-1-0_B2.csv’ from the zip archive
‘infinium-methylationepic-v1-0-b2-manifest-file-csv.zip’ from www.illumina.com.
